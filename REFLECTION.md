# Reflection

In this project, I learned how to use `fetch()` and async/await to get real data from the City of Winnipeg API.

Debugging helped me understand how data moves step by step from the user input, to the API call, and then to the web page.

I also saw how `try catch` handle and catch errors.
I feel more confident using APIs and async functions in JavaScript.
